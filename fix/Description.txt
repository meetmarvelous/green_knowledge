Description
My project is about using barcode technology to help identify and document the different tree species in the Botanical Garden at the University of Ibadan. The idea is to make it easier for people, like students, researchers, and visitors to learn more about the trees in a quick and interactive way. First, I will walk through the garden and record important details about each tree, such as its scientific name, local name, uses, physical features, and location. After collecting all this information, I will create a digital record for each tree.

Then, I will generate a unique barcode or QR code for every tree. These barcodes will be printed and attached to the trees on weather-resistant labels. When someone scans a barcode using a smartphone or barcode scanner, they will instantly see all the information about that particular tree on a website. This makes learning about the trees more fun, faster, and more accurate. It will also help in keeping a digital inventory of the trees and tracking their health and growth over time. Overall, the project is meant to make the garden smarter and more educational for everyone who visits or works there.

*Estimated number of trees*
40 tree species from 20 families would be spread across the garden in 4 frequencies each, making a total of 160 trees that would be tagged.

3. Family Name
Combretaceae


4. Origin and Distribution
Native to West and Central Africa.
Found in tropical rainforests across Nigeria, Ghana, Cameroon, and Congo.
Commonly cultivated in forest reserves and botanical gardens in Nigeria.


5. Physical Description
A tall deciduous tree reaching 30–45 meters in height.
Straight, cylindrical bole often branchless up to 20 meters.
Bark is smooth to slightly fissured, greyish-brown in color.
Leaves are simple, arranged in whorls near branch tips, elliptical in shape.
Flowers are small, creamy-white, and borne in slender spikes.
Fruits are winged, resembling a small propeller.


6. Ecological Information
Prefers well-drained, deep loamy soils.
Grows best in humid lowland forests with full sunlight.
Tolerates secondary forest conditions.
Flowers around February to April and fruits between May and July.
Provides shade and helps reduce soil erosion.


7. Conservation Status
Listed as Least Concern on the IUCN Red List.
However, locally threatened in areas due to overexploitation for timber.


8. Uses and Economic Importance
Highly valued for timber—lightweight and easy to work with.
Used in furniture, veneer, plywood, and interior finishing.
Bark is used in traditional medicine for treating cough and infections.
Culturally significant in some communities as a symbol of prestige.
Often planted for reforestation and ornamental purposes.

UI-BG-TS-012

12. Health and Condition
Healthy, with no visible signs of disease or pest infestation.
Bark intact; crown is full with healthy green foliage.


13. Remarks or Notes
Often mistaken for Triplochiton scleroxylon due to similar growth form.
Its light-colored wood and rapid growth make it a preferred species in sustainable timber farming and forest plantation trials.
