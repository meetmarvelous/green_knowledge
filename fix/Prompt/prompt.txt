Improve this prompt below from the details above,add details that aren't added to the prompt already concise and well detailed:

Build a Web Application for details above
Overview: (give me concisely)


Key Features:

A main webpage that gives where all trees are listed by family, tree species. (with search functionality at the nav bar)
A tree details page for each tree showing all details of the tree.
A search page to search for any details of any tree from the database.
An admin dashboard to manage the website for CRUD operations, and can export the QR code picture for each tree link
and other pages .

Database Design:
The application uses a MySQL database, add every other necessary features and tables.

Frontend Design:
Built with Bootstrap 5 for responsive, modern styling, and User-friendly.

Admin Dashboard :
Create, read, edit, delete all trees details from the database.
Making it possible to add new tree details (table data) for all trees and delete any existing one for all trees
Be able to create QR code pictures that will never expire that link to the web page of each tree page.

Technology Stack:
Backend: PHP (Procedural), MySQL (MySQLi Procedural).
Frontend: HTML, CSS, Bootstrap 5, JavaScript (optional for enhanced interactivity).
Development Tools: XAMPP or any local server setup for testing.
QR Code generation integration.


DB_HOST=localhost
DB_USER=root
DB_PASSWORD=
DB_NAME=green_knowledge

Instructions for Building the Application:
Create other necessary files
Give me the file structure first, then give me the file codes
______________________________________________

______________________________________________


Im using xampp for now. it shows - You don't have permission to access this resource.
Do not # Redirect to HTTPS if not already. and remove other unnecssary .htacess code for now. Give me two versions  (.htaccess - the one for xampp testing, and .htacces2 (the one I will use later)


The code is not loading the index since there is none, fix that , note that we have our homepag in the pages folder


The search nav bar from a file in pages/ move to 
http://localhost/Recent/Green//pages/pages/search.php?q=khaya when used , and the file cant be found , fix that too

______________________________________________

Nav bar toggle not working on mobile. Fix 

Then let's move to the admin dashboard. There will be be a lot of restructuring. 

QR code code generation is not working at all. Fix that, let's use proper debugging messages during this development to know where the problem is 

Quick action buttons should be added to every admin dashboard page for easy navigation.

Key note : The names of the generated QR images should be saved to database too for proper recording. I want each QR generated images  to be ever working because it will be printed on a flyer that will be shared to the masses, in the sense that even if another GQ code is being generated, the existing one will still work for that particular link. pls handle deleting and updating trees properly so there won't be mix up and affect the records later (e.g prevent mixing up the tree Id with their link id with that of their respective QR code) 


Now give me the new codes to add, the ones to update and the new database schema to add or update. 


Let's create an admin page to manage Plant Families, includes/quick_actions.php for this.

The tree images are not uploading and updating after trying to add from the manage tree section in admin dashboard. It didnt update to both database and folder. Fix that. Use proper feedback for debuging purposes.

Give me the updated admin files like its index and others because of the updated features like family.php, and others.

For the QR management page, The QR code picture was generated and it worked when I used it from the folder directly but whenever I download to my device using the download button. the png file wont open hence not able to scan. fix that too
______________________________________________

edit.php still not working for uploading pictures. didnt drop the pictures to database or folder. fix that and give me the full code (with proper feedback alert messages for key processes to know where issue is). check for that of  add.php too. Give the full code for both

Also,
because of .htacess file and other reasons , to check tree details from http://localhost/Recent/Green/ , it navigates to http://localhost/Recent/Green/tree.php?id=1 instead of http://localhost/Recent/Green/pages/tree.php?id=1 from some other pages and  http://localhost/Recent/Green/ (which I think is loading from pages/index.php normally). Fix that too

it takes me back to admin/dashboard.php without executing the final upload, until I open the edit.php in admin/trees again then the previous edit get completed which isnt supposed to be
and The pictures was uploaded to \Green\admin\trees\assets\images\tree_photos  instead of Green\assets\images\tree_photos

Fix both 
Tree updated successfully!


Also note that the current tree pic path actually work for pages/trees.php and others, but not the admin, so lets fix properly.

when I click update tree on edit.php, it takes me back to admin/index.php without executing the upload tasks, until I open the edit.php?id=(the numberid) again before it get completed, which isnt supposed to be. Fix 


It tries to download from .....Green\assets\images\qr_codes instead of  ...Green\admin\assets\images\qr_codes
lets fix that alone, which line wil I fix

when I searched khaya from
Froom
http://localhost/Recent/Green/pages/list.php ( and other files in pages folder)
http://localhost/Recent/Green/admin/dashboard.php ( and other files in admin folder) respectively
it moved to
http://localhost/Recent/Green/pages/pages/search.php?q=khaya
http://localhost/Recent/Green/admin/pages/search.php?q=khaya respectively

instead http://localhost/Recent/Green/pages/search.php?q=khaya

lets fix, without effect other pages.

______________________________________________

Act like a world-class frontend developer.

Lets create a PAGE BANNER with breadcrumb for all pages except the admin pages. 
For the homepage, Let it be a slider without breadcrumb but action buttons.

Use sample pictures I will replace later.


For devices with nav bar toggler, How do I make it appear over the slider or banner when clicked instead of pushing it down

Update the table structure in a way that it will be able to take those data correctly.
I will give you the data in csv format,, insert them into the restructed SQL table. Then provide the new SQL with the given data.

After that, lets edit necessary files like tree.php , admin/trees/edit.php, admin/trees/add.php and every other necessaryfile to edit
